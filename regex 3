Problem 1:

Write a JavaScript function to count the number of vowels in a given string using a regular expression. DO NOT USE loops or if statements
(Hint: use exec or match and look at the modifiers on the website below)

use the name:
function countVowels

Problem 2:

Write a JavaScript function to test if the words: dog, cat, or chicken is in a string.

(Hint: you will need to use \b for a word boundary)

Simply put: \b allows you to perform a "whole words only" search using a regular expression in the form of \bword\b.  A "word character" is a character that can be used to form words. All  characters that are not "word characters" are "non-word characters" 

use the name:
function animalCount

function countVowels(str){
  var count = 0;
  var re = /[aeiou]/ig;
  var x = str.match(re);
  
  return x.length;
  
}
var str = 'here we are';
console.log(countVowels(str));


function animalCount(str){
  var re = /\b (dog|cat|chicken)s?\b/;
  var x = re.test(str);
  return x;
}
var str = 'a cat then a dog and finally a chicken';
console.log(animalCount(str));
